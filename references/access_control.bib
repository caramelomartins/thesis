"We propose DACC (Distributed Access Control in Clouds) algorithm, where one or more KDCs distribute keys to data owners and users." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"DACC also supports revocation of users, without redistributing keys to all the users of cloud services. We show that our approach results in lower communication, computation and storage overheads, compared to existing models and schemes." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"Hence we use the cryptographic technique called Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) to achieve access control in clouds." (Ruj et al 2011:91)
"Earlier work (by Yu et al [17]) assumed that owners encrypt data with attributes that they possess and send it to the cloud to securely store them. The owners give not only access rights to users, but also give them attributes and corresponding secret keys." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"The access policy is in the form of a tree, with attributes" (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"as leaf nodes and Boolean functions AND and OR as internal nodes. Threshold gates t-out-of-n are included in this representation, because they are constructed from AND and OR gates when t = n and t = 1, respectively." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"However, this may not hold, because in a distributed system, authorities can fail or be corrupt." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"The attribute authority (KDC) in all mentioned protocols is assumed to be honest. However, this may not hold, because in a distributed system, authorities can fail or be corrupt." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"Chase and Chow [24] devised a multi-authority ABE protocol which required no trusted authority. However, the main problem was that a user required at least one attribute from each of the authorities, which might not be practical." (Ruj et al 2011:92)
"ABE was used for access control. They used cryptographic protocol [24], with multiple authorities to distribute attributes for access control." (Ruj et al 2011:93)
"Wang et al [26] proposed a hierarchical access control mechanism for cloud storage. It relies on Bethencourt et al [22] CP-ABE and Hierarchical IBE [27]. The attribute authorities are arranged in a hierarchical way, with a root master (playing the role of a trusted KDC), and several domain masters who generate keys for the domains and distribute them to the users." (Ruj et al 2011:93)
"In DACC, the cloud is assumed to be honest. If this requirement is not possible to satisfy, then care should be taken, that the cloud does not modify the data that it contains." (Ruj et al 2011:97)

"We propose a new decentralized access control scheme for secure data storage in clouds, that supports anonymous authentication." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"This is achieved by means of searchable encryption [3], [4]." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"It is important to have log of the transactions performed; however, it is an important concern to decide how much information to keep in the log. Accountability has been addressed in TrustCloud [8]. Secure provenance has been studied in [9]." (Ruj et al 2014:384)
"Access control in clouds is gaining attention because it is important that only authorized users have access to valid service. A huge amount of information is being stored in the cloud, and much of this is sensitive information. Care should be taken to ensure access control of this sensitive information" (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There are broadly three types of access control: User Based Access Control (UBAC), Role Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There has been some work on ABAC in clouds (for example, [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). All these work use a cryptographic primitive known as Attribute Based Encryption (ABE). The The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [17] has been proposed for ABAC in clouds [18]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Access control in health care has been studied in [12], [13]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Access control in online social networking has been studied in [19]." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"There are cryptographic protocols like ring signatures [20], mesh signatures [21], group signatures [22], which can be used in these situations." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"a new protocol known as Attribute Based Signature (ABS) has been applied. ABS was proposed by Maji et al. [23]. In ABS, users have a claim predicate associated with a message." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Existing work [38], [18], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] on access control in cloud are centralized in nature." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"Although Yang et al. [34] proposed a decentralized approach, their technique does not authenticate users, who want to remain anonymous while accessing the cloud. In an earlier work, Ruj et al. [16] proposed a distributed access control mechanism in clouds." (Ruj et al 2014:385)
"We have presented a decentralized access control technique with anonymous authentication, which provides user revocation and prevents replay attacks. The cloud does not know the identity of the user who stores information, but only verifies the user's credentials. Key distribution is done in a decentralized way. One limitation is that the cloud knows the access policy for each record stored in the cloud. In future, we would like to hide the attributes and access policy of a user." (Ruj et al 2014:393)

"In order to permit a requested operation, a reference monitor must verify evidence that the request should be granted. In classical approaches to access control, this evidence may be the presence of an authenticated identity on an access-control list, or the verification of a capability presented with the request." (Bauer et al 2005:81)
"In this paper, we introduce a distributed strategy by which this proof can be generated and show that the strategy outperforms prior approaches in many contexts." (Bauer et al 2005:81)
"In traditional approaches to distributed authorization, credentials are distributed across multiple users. A single user (either the requester of a resource or its owner, depending on the model) is responsible for proving that access should be allowed, and in the course of proving the user may fetch credentials from other users. All users except for the one proving access are passive; their only responsibility is to make their credentials available for download. We propose a different model: each user is both a repository of credentials and an active participant in the proof-generation process. In this model, a user who is generating a proof is now able to ask other users not only for their certificates, but also to prove for him subgoals that are part of his proof. Each user has a tactical theorem prover that he uses to prove both his own and other users' goals. In such a system there are multiple strategies for creating proofs." (Bauer et al 2005:84)
"Previous work on distributed authorization systems largely did not focus on practical strategies for collecting the certificates used to show that a request satisfies an access-control policy. However, attention to these strategies is necessary for the deployment of rich certificatebased access control, particularly in cases where credentials are created dynamically with user involvement."

"In the light of these considerations, we opted to use an Access List mechanism in Andrew." (Satyanarayanan 1989:261)
"An entry in an access list maps a member of the protection domain into a set of Rights, which are merely bit positions in a 32-bit mask. The interpretation of rights is specific to each Vice service." (Satyanarayanan 1989:261)
"Vice associates an access list with each directory." (Satyanarayanan 1989:262)},

	abstract = {There is an increasing gap between the needs of modern, complex, and distributed environments in regards to control of access to data and the level to which classical access control solutions can fulfill those needs. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the current state of art of existing research over access control in increasingly decentralized environments and to argue how the subject of access control is more relevant than ever before, with increasing research opportunities emerging. In this chapter, the authors analyze the current state of the art of access control mechanisms and systems over decentralized applications with a focus on enterprise ecosystems, analyze the current challenges and opportunities that the new technological landscape offers, specifically over the application of blockchain-based technologies in access control, and propose new research directions for the future.},
